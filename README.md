100 Days of Code - Python

This repository contains my progress through the 100 Days of Code - Python challenge. Each day features a new project, focusing on different aspects of Python development. Below is a brief overview of the projects completed so far.

Day 1: Band Name Generator

A simple introduction to Python, focusing on user input and string manipulation to generate a band name based on user responses.

Day 2: Tip Calculator

A program that calculates the total bill, including tip percentage, and splits it among a group.

Concepts: Variables, Data Types, Arithmetic Operations, f-strings

Day 3: Treasure Island (Text-Based Adventure Game)

An interactive game using conditional statements where the player navigates through choices to find treasure.

Concepts: If/Else Statements, Nested Conditions, Logical Operators

Day 4: Rock, Paper, Scissors

A game that simulates Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer, incorporating randomness.

Concepts: Lists, Random Module, Loops

Day 5: Password Generator

A program that generates a random password based on user preferences for length and complexity.

Concepts: Lists, Loops, Random Choice, String Manipulation

Day 6: Reeborgâ€™s World Maze Solver

A challenge in Reeborgâ€™s World to navigate a maze using a structured approach.

Concepts: Functions, Loops, Conditional Logic

Day 7: Hangman

A text-based Hangman game where the user guesses letters to reveal a hidden word.

Concepts: Lists, Loops, String Manipulation, ASCII Art

Day 8: Caesar Cipher

A program that encrypts and decrypts messages using the Caesar cipher method.

Concepts: Functions, Lists, Modulo Arithmetic, String Manipulation

Day 9: Silent Auction

A program that manages a blind auction, determining the highest bidder.

Concepts: Dictionaries, Loops, User Input Validation

Day 10: Calculator

A basic calculator that allows continuous calculations while offering the option to retain previous results.

Concepts: Functions, Dictionaries, Recursion, Input Validation

Day 11: Blackjack (Capstone Project)

A text-based Blackjack game simulating a real casino experience, including game logic for the dealer and player.

Concepts: Lists, Dictionaries, Random Module, Game Logic, Functions

This README will be updated as I progress through the challenge. Stay tuned for more projects! ðŸš€
