# 100-days-of-python
This repo will be a collection of my projects from the udemy 100 days of code course, I will not be including any projects that were made with excessive guidence or the ones made during lessons.

Day 1 - Band Name Generator:
  This is a really simple project that simply takes 2 strings as input from the user and concatenates them together

Day 2 - Tip Calculator:
  Another really simple project that takes the amount of people paying for a meal and a tip percentage they'd like to give and figures out how much each person needs to pay
